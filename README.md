Single-Joint Motion Simulation & PID Optimization
Project Description: This project simulates the motion of a single robotic joint from 0° → 90° using Linear, Cubic, and PID control. Experiments include parameter sweeps, PID tuning, and automated optimization to identify the optimal PID gains for fastest, most accurate motion.
Experiments Overview:
Experiment 1 - Linear vs. Cubic Motion
Experiment 2 - Parameter Sweep: Total Time & Steps
Experiment 3 - PID Control of a Single Joint
Experiment 4 - Optimal PID tuning (find best Kp, Ki, Kd) 
Experiment 5 - Comparison of Motion Methods 
Skills Demonstrated:
Python (NumPy, Matplotlib, CSV handling)
Control systems (PID)
Data collection and analysis
Research-style optimization
Clean folder organization for reproducibility
